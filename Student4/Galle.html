    <h1>Galle</h1>
    <div class="dis">
        <p>
            The capital of the southern province is a city with a colourful history. UNESCO declared World Heritage Site the magnificent Dutch fort is the most popular attraction of the town. 300-year-old Dutch atmosphere is still very much alive around the fort and amidst its many historical buildings not invaded by the skyscrapers. Today’s town has grown greatly and spreads into the surroundings but the Fort is the slow beating heart of Galle‘s history. The walled city has stood since the early sixteenth century, through the Colonial periods of the Portuguese, Dutch and British and in our present times is proclaimed as an Archaeological Reserve and has been identified as a living World Heritage Site.
